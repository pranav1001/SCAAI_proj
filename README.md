# SCAAI Project
Movie review analysis on IMDB Reviews dataset.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.

Text analysis contains data exploration and understanding

SCAAI_final contains the tensorflow model that uses Swivel gives a validation accuracy of 0.88 and training accuracy of  0.96

SCAAI_LSTM contains the lstm model for text classification gives a validation accuracy of 0.82 and training accuracy of  0.90

ANN contains a nn model which gives a validation accuracy of 0.88 and training accuracy of  0.90

model3 uses GLoVe embedding method and that gives us a training accuracy of 0.9236 and val_acc: 0.7481
