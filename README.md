# SCAAI Project
Movie review analysis on IMDB Reviews dataset.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.
***I have used Tensorflow notebook that uses tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Hub, a library and platform for transfer learning. I have modified it a bit by and a dropout layer and Tensorboard for model visualization***
